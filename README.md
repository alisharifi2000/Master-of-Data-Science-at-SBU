The Master of Science in Data Science allows students to apply data science techniques to their field of interest, building on seven foundational courses offered in our center. Our students have the opportunity to conduct original research, included in a capstone project, and interact with our industry partners and faculty. The final offer of courses for each semester is published in the pre-registration, which starts in June for Fall semester and in November for Spring semester. The course offer tends to be relatively stable in both Fall and Spring semesters, however, it may differ slightly according to the current offer. The list is subject to change based on faculty availability and student demand.
